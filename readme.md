## Usage
You can use this template for your website for free. This template created by @meszmate

Website logo is your logo.jpg file.<br/>
If you testing on your computer, maybe you have to change "/logo.jpg" to "logo.jpg".<br/>
href = "link to your account".<br/>
Remove "target=..." if you dont want to open links in new window.<br/>
I recommend to use base64 url instead of "/logo.jpg" for image to body for fastest load.
